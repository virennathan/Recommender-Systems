One feature that can tell about how a beer will taste is the ABV and the style. For the different styles                  of beer, I listed them by the proportion of the style that had review/overall >= 4. I noticed that stouts, IPAs, Ales, and Porters were typically well reviewed and popular styles in general. Thus, I did a one-hot encoding for these                  styles; if a beer wasn't any of these styles, then the one-hot encoding would be all zeros. I thought that the review rating subcategories could help predict the overall score. Thus, I added the features for aroma, palate, and                   taste ratings which I believed to be most indicative of the overall score. With these features, I achieved a BER of 0.1760 vs the previous BER of 0.4683", 0.17595629485511854]}
